Questions

    How can your implementation be optimized?
The references to other gameobjects could be filled out through the inspector manually by developers in a public
 array so as to remove the code lines 17-22 in Player.cs
The triggering of GetClosest() in Player.cs FixedUpdate could instead be triggered upon movement
 
    How much time did you spend on your implementation?
About an hour to an hour and a half

    What was most challenging for you?
Recognizing that the Item and Bot scripts were functionally derivitave and could instead have a shared parent class
 that held all the relevant funcitonality. And that that left me with two almost empty derived classes purely for
 the naming requirements.

    What else would you add to this exercise?
The Base functionality of this was relatively small. Maybe some of the optional extras would be great, like
 randomly changing the position of the Items/Bot each time the game is ran.
